Intro
-----

Well, it all started one day when I had an idea. Most of you all know the story. Anyway, this "modified" ROM of Tecmo Super Bowl features many of the regulars from the GameFAQs NES Tecmo Super Bowl board, as well as a few extra characters many of you know and love. Well, I don't know what else to put in this intro, so I'm going to get on with now.

FAQ (No pun intended)
---------------------

Who are all these people? What is GameFAQs?
Um, these are people that regularly post on the NES Tecmo Super Bowl board on GameFAQs, which is a web site that has FAQs, reviews, and message boards for any video or computer game on any system. If you're asking this question, then this particular ROM is not intended for you.

Why is my name different? That's not the one I told you.
Well, I changed some of the names around so they would look better in the game. For example, I changed my own name (Nester the Great) to "The Great Nester" because it would display "Great" or "TheGreat" in several different places where it displays the last name. If I really messed up on it, or you don't like it, for whatever reason, let me know.

OMG! What did you do to my player??
Well, I had to change some stats on certain players because they were too unrealistic. Some people were using numbers that were too high or too low for a certain position (I actually had to make some people better!). Also I tried to make all the players around 43 or 44 overall (according to TSB Manager 2000). Some people explained their stats so I let theirs slide. BUT if you really don't like it we can negotiate. I just don't want to make it too hard or too easy to use any player/play the team.

Uh, Wha?
If you don't understand any of this put this file and the ROM in your recycle bin. That's all I can tell ya.
